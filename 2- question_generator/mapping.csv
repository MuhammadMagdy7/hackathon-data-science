"==== Analysis ====
Several analyses can be used during the initial data analysis phase:
Univariate statistics (single variable)
Bivariate associations (correlations)
Graphical techniques (scatter plots)It is important to take the measurement levels of the variables into account for the analyses, as special statistical techniques are available for each level:
Nominal and ordinal variables
Frequency counts (numbers and percentages)
Associations
circumambulations (crosstabulations)
hierarchical loglinear analysis (restricted to a maximum of 8 variables)
loglinear analysis (to identify relevant/important variables and possible confounders)
Exact tests or bootstrapping (in case subgroups are small)
Computation of new variables
Continuous variables
Distribution
Statistics (M, SD, variance, skewness, kurtosis)
Stem-and-leaf displays
Box plots


==== Nonlinear analysis ====
Nonlinear analysis is often necessary when the data is recorded from a nonlinear system."
"These include:

Check raw data for anomalies prior to performing an analysis;
Re-perform important calculations, such as verifying columns of data that are formula driven;
Confirm main totals are the sum of subtotals;
Check relationships between numbers that should be related in a predictable way, such as ratios over time;
Normalize numbers to make comparisons easier, such as analyzing amounts per person or relative to GDP or as an index value relative to a base year;
Break problems into component parts by analyzing factors that led to the results, such as DuPont analysis of return on equity.For the variables under examination, analysts typically obtain descriptive statistics for them, such as the mean (average), median, and standard deviation."

"==== Analysis ====
Several analyses can be used during the initial data analysis phase:
Univariate statistics (single variable)
Bivariate associations (correlations)
Graphical techniques (scatter plots)It is important to take the measurement levels of the variables into account for the analyses, as special statistical techniques are available for each level:
Nominal and ordinal variables
Frequency counts (numbers and percentages)
Associations
circumambulations (crosstabulations)
hierarchical loglinear analysis (restricted to a maximum of 8 variables)
loglinear analysis (to identify relevant/important variables and possible confounders)
Exact tests or bootstrapping (in case subgroups are small)
Computation of new variables
Continuous variables
Distribution
Statistics (M, SD, variance, skewness, kurtosis)
Stem-and-leaf displays
Box plots


==== Nonlinear analysis ====
Nonlinear analysis is often necessary when the data is recorded from a nonlinear system."

"These include:

Check raw data for anomalies prior to performing an analysis;
Re-perform important calculations, such as verifying columns of data that are formula driven;
Confirm main totals are the sum of subtotals;
Check relationships between numbers that should be related in a predictable way, such as ratios over time;
Normalize numbers to make comparisons easier, such as analyzing amounts per person or relative to GDP or as an index value relative to a base year;
Break problems into component parts by analyzing factors that led to the results, such as DuPont analysis of return on equity.For the variables under examination, analysts typically obtain descriptive statistics for them, such as the mean (average), median, and standard deviation."

"During this analysis, one inspects the variances of the items and the scales, the Cronbach's α of the scales, and the change in the Cronbach's alpha when an item would be deleted from a scale


==== Initial transformations ====
After assessing the quality of the data and of the measurements, one might decide to impute missing data, or to perform initial transformations of one or more variables, although this can also be done during the main analysis phase."
"Hypothesis testing involves considering the likelihood of Type I and type II errors, which relate to whether the data supports accepting or rejecting the hypothesis.Regression analysis may be used when the analyst is trying to determine the extent to which independent variable X affects dependent variable Y (e.g., ""To what extent do changes in the unemployment rate (X) affect the inflation rate (Y)?"")."
"Whereas (multiple) regression analysis uses additive logic where each X-variable can produce the outcome and the X's can compensate for each other (they are sufficient but not necessary), necessary condition analysis (NCA) uses necessity logic, where one or more X-variables allow the outcome to exist, but may not produce it (they are necessary but not sufficient)."

"This is an attempt to model or fit an equation line or curve to the data, such that Y is a function of X.Necessary condition analysis (NCA) may be used when the analyst is trying to determine the extent to which independent variable X allows variable Y (e.g., ""To what extent is a certain unemployment rate (X) necessary for a certain inflation rate (Y)?"")."
"Statistician John Tukey, defined data analysis in 1961, as:""Procedures for analyzing data, techniques for interpreting the results of such procedures, ways of planning the gathering of data to make its analysis easier, more precise or more accurate, and all the machinery and results of (mathematical) statistics which apply to analyzing data."
"For example, when analysts perform financial statement analysis, they will often recast the financial statements under different assumptions to help arrive at an estimate of future cash flow, which they then discount to present value based on some interest rate, to determine the valuation of the company or its stock."
"When a model is found exploratory in a dataset, then following up that analysis with a confirmatory analysis in the same dataset could simply mean that the results of the confirmatory analysis are due to the same type 1 error that resulted in the exploratory model in the first place."

"=== Initial data analysis ===
The most important distinction between the initial data analysis phase and the main analysis phase, is that during initial data analysis one refrains from any analysis that is aimed at answering the original research question."
"In his book Psychology of Intelligence Analysis, retired CIA analyst Richards Heuer wrote that analysts should clearly delineate their assumptions and chains of inference and specify the degree and source of the uncertainty involved in the conclusions."
"Data quality can be assessed in several ways, using different types of analysis: frequency counts, descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median), normality (skewness, kurtosis, frequency histograms), normal imputation is needed."
"In order to do this, several decisions about the main data analyses can and should be made:

In the case of non-normals: should one transform variables; make variables categorical (ordinal/dichotomous); adapt the analysis method?"
"=== Data requirements ===
The data is necessary as inputs to the analysis, which is specified based upon the requirements of those directing the analytics (or customers, who will use the finished product of the analysis)."

"=== Analytics and business intelligence ===

Analytics is the ""extensive use of data, statistical and quantitative analysis, explanatory and predictive models, and fact-based management to drive decisions and actions."""
"=== Main data analysis ===
In the main analysis phase, analyses aimed at answering the research question are performed as well as any other relevant analysis needed to write the first draft of the research report."
"There are two ways to assess measurement quality:

Confirmatory factor analysis
Analysis of homogeneity (internal consistency), which gives an indication of the reliability of a measurement instrument."

"For instance, these may involve placing data into rows and columns in a table format (known as structured data) for further analysis, often through the use of spreadsheet or statistical software."
"For example, regression analysis may be used to model whether a change in advertising (independent variable X), provides an explanation for the variation in sales (dependent variable Y)."
"By splitting the data into multiple parts, we can check if an analysis (like a fitted model) based on one part of the data generalizes to another part of the data as well."
"=== Confusing fact and opinion ===

Effective analysis requires obtaining relevant facts to answer questions, support a conclusion or formal opinion, or test hypotheses."
"== Barriers to effective analysis ==
Barriers to effective analysis may exist among the analysts performing the data analysis or among the audience."
"== Barriers to effective analysis ==
Barriers to effective analysis may exist among the analysts performing the data analysis or among the audience."
"In an exploratory analysis no clear hypothesis is stated before analysing the data, and the data is searched for models that describe the data well."
"=== Communication ===

Once data is analyzed, it may be reported in many formats to the users of the analysis to support their requirements."
"Analysts may also attempt to build models that are descriptive of the data, in an aim to simplify analysis and communicate results."
"== The process of data analysis ==

Analysis, refers to dividing a whole into its separate components for individual examination."
Analysis of extreme observations: outlying observations in the data are analyzed to see if they seem to disturb the distribution.
In a confirmatory analysis clear hypotheses about the data are tested.Exploratory data analysis should be interpreted carefully.
"Facts by definition are irrefutable, meaning that any person involved in the analysis should be able to agree upon them."
"Also, one should not follow up an exploratory analysis with a confirmatory analysis in the same dataset."
"Also, one should not follow up an exploratory analysis with a confirmatory analysis in the same dataset."
The confirmatory analysis therefore will not be more informative than the original exploratory analysis.

"=== Data processing ===

Data, when initially obtained, must be processed or organized for analysis."
"=== Cognitive biases ===
There are a variety of cognitive biases that can adversely affect analysis."
"An exploratory analysis is used to find ideas for a theory, but not to test that theory as well."
Julia - A programming language well-suited for numerical analysis and computational science.
This requires extensive analysis of factual data and evidence to support their opinion.
In the case of outliers: should one use robust analysis techniques?
"The users may have feedback, which results in additional analysis."
"A histogram, a type of bar chart, may be used for this analysis."
Screening data prior to analysis.
Sensitivity analysis.
"When a model is found exploratory in a dataset, then following up that analysis with a confirmatory analysis in the same dataset could simply mean that the results of the confirmatory analysis are due to the same type 1 error that resulted in the exploratory model in the first place."

Once the datasets are cleaned, they can then be analyzed."
"In today's business world, data analysis plays a role in making decisions more scientific and helping businesses operate more effectively.Data mining is a particular data analysis technique that focuses on statistical modeling and knowledge discovery for predictive rather than purely descriptive purposes, while business intelligence covers data analysis that relies heavily on aggregation, focusing mainly on business information."
