# Project Analysis: Question Answering System & Temperature Change Analysis

This repository contains two main projects: a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project for building a Question Answering system, and a Data Analysis project for analyzing temperature changes.

## 1. Question Answering System

This project focuses on building a system that can understand and answer questions based on a given text. It involves keyphrase extraction, question generation, and question answering.

### Files

* `Keyphrase.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for extracting keyphrases from text.
* `question_generation.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for generating questions from text.
* `Youtubeing.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for building the question answering model.
* `quesation.csv`: A CSV file containing a list of questions for training or testing the system.

### How to Run

1.  Open the Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb` files) in a suitable environment (like Jupyter Lab or Google Colab).
2.  Ensure all required libraries are installed.
3.  Run the cells in the notebooks sequentially to see the process of keyphrase extraction, question generation, and question answering.

## 2. Temperature Change Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing historical temperature change data to identify trends and patterns.

### Files

* `Environment_Temperature_change_E_All_Data_NOFLAG.csv`: A CSV file containing temperature change data for various countries and regions.
* `Temperature_change_Data.csv`: A CSV file with additional temperature change data.

### How to Run

1.  Use a data analysis library like Pandas in Python to load and analyze the `.csv` files.
2.  You can perform various analyses such as trend analysis, comparative analysis, and data visualization to explore the data.
