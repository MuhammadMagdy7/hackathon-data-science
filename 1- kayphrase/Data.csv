statistical modelling,['In todays business world data analysis plays a role in making decisions more scientific and helping businesses operate more effectively.Data mining is a particular data analysis technique that focuses on statistical modelling and knowledge discovery for predictive rather than purely descriptive purposes while business intelligence covers data analysis that relies heavily on aggregation focusing mainly on business information.']
